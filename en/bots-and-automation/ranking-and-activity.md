# Ranking & Activity

As you might have noticed, using the TeamSpeak grants you levels from time to time. Your level is determined by the active time you've spent on the server. The system is designed to benefit active people, not talkative people, so don't worry if you're rather quiet, we've got you back üòâ The system was introduced in October 2017.

### Where can I see the leaderboard?

You can find all kinds of statistics [here](https://ranksystem.opossumts.net).

### What do I get from leveling up?

Depending on your Level you gain multiple perks. Your rank in the server leaderboard doesn't matter, it's just about the level itself. Check the table below for more details.

Even level up increases your talk power, meaning you'll get sorted higher in the channel. Also, there are some special perks awarded every 5 levels.

{spoiler: Level 5}With Level 5 you're now able to move Music Bots to your own channel and enjoy some music!
{spoiler: Level 10}At Level 10 you gain the ability to create complaints via TeamSpeak. Our Staff will instantly be notified to help you whenever someone is bugging you.
{spoiler: Level 15}Once you've reached Level 15, you're seen as a thrustworthy member of our community. You may now move new users to get your friends to you if they first connect.
{spoiler: Level 20}Level 20 rewards you with one month of free Premium & gain the ability to whisper.
{spoiler: Level 25}1000 Points for free. That's it :)
{spoiler: Level 30}A Teee for Freeee üéÅ

In case of misuse of these rights they will be removed! Trying to improve your rank by fraud such as continuous send is punished with permanent exclusion from the ranking.

### Are there any extra perks for being beneath the top 10?

Not directly, but the first 20 users to reach Level 30 get a free t-shirt from our shop ü§ó Shipping included, available worldwide!

### These levels are annoying, how can I get rid of them?

If you want to disable ranking, please contact our team. Keep in mind that you won't be able to get any of the above-mentioned [level perks](#) if your ranking is disabled.

### Is there a way I can level faster?

Yep, there is. Boosts can drastically speed up your leveling process. They may be awarded during special events or can be bought using points on our boards. You can also receive a 2x boost every 12 hours by voting for our server. You can learn more about voting here.

### What does 'active time' even mean?

That's a great question. Unfortunately, it's not easy to answer. Once you interact on the Server in any way, a timer starts ticking. A fairly big period after this will be counted as active time (to ensure quite people are not being let down). We can't tell you how long exactly, as this varies depending on multiple external factors. Also, we want to keep the competition as fair as possible. To prevent cheating, detailed information on the tracking algorithm is not publicly available.
