### Why should I connect my account?

Connecting your Twitch Account makes sure you get the corresponding server- and channelgroups for streamers that you're subscribed to or following.

### I've already connected my account, where are my groups?

To increase performance and due to twitch limits, the check interval is currently limited to once every 15 minutes. It might take a while for you to get your groups assigned.

### Can I disconnect my account?

Manually disconnecting your account isn't possible at the moment. If you want to get your account disconnected, please contact the admin team. You can also revoke our access to your account via the twitch dashboard at any time.

### I'm a streamer, can you add groups for my viewers?

No easy answer here. Let's say it depends. Give our team a yell, we'll take care of it :)
